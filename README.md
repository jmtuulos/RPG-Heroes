# RPG Heroes - Console Application in Java
This project is a console application in Java called "RPG Heroes" that allows users to create and customize hero characters, equip them with various weapons and armor, and level them up to increase their attributes. In the game there are four classes that a hero can be: Mage, Ranger, Rogue, and Warrior. Each hero has shared fields such as name, level, level attributes and equipment.

Hero Attributes
The attribute system found in this assignment is based on the traditional Three-Stat System leaning towards a Diablo 3 implementation. The hero attributes are as follows:

Strength: determines the physical strength of the character.
Dexterity: determines the character's ability to attack with speed and nimbleness.
Intelligence: determines the character's affinity with magic.

The project has a automated testing implemented with Github actions.

To make the game playable a game loop still needs to be implemented.
